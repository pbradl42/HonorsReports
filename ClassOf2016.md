## Qualitative Service

Aryn Cowley
"The most meaningful service experience I had in Honors was volunteering at the Mother and Daughter TEA (technology,engineering, aptitude) events. During these events, mothers and daughters were exposed to engineering programs at Ferris and were able to work together to complete a small engineering project we had set up for them. I loved being able to be a role model to the younger girls and inspire them to become and engineer. I also enjoyed sharing my knowledge on the projects that the mothers and daughters were working on. Being able to tell my story of wanting to become and engineer and inspiring future generations of engineers is a great feeling.”

Zachary Kramer
"I had the incredible opportunity to volunteer abroad last summer. I traveled to the Dominican Republic with some of the Pre-Medicine Club. We spent a week traveling to rural villages while providing medical services…Aside from learning valuable healthcare skills, I met the kindest group of people I have ever encountered. The people we served were by far the poorest people I have ever seen. Even though we were there to serve them, they wanted to serve us.”

## Qualitative Service

Bradley Bohle
On Service
"The most meaningful service project that I had while in Honors was helping out some of the flood victims by cleaning out their houses when the river flooded two years ago. It was sad that people lost so much but it had a great impact on me being able to help out some of those families.”

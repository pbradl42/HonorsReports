```{r, echo=FALSE}
#jpeg(filename = "GenEd-Traditional.jpg", units = "px", width = 800, height = 400)
melt(tradgeneds, id.vars="Semester", measure.vars=c("GlobalConsciousness", "CulturalEnrichment", "SocialAwareness", "SocialAwareFoundation")) -> melted
p <- ggplot(melted, aes(x=Semester, y = value, fill=variable)) + geom_bar(position="stack", stat="identity") + ggtitle("Traditional Gen Eds, by Semester")
print(p)
#dev.off()
